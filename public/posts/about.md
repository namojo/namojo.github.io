Hello! I'm a software engineer with a passion for building scalable web applications. This blog serves as my digital garden where I cultivate ideas, document my learning process, and share tutorials on modern web development.

I specialize in the React ecosystem, TypeScript, and cloud architecture. When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source projects or exploring the latest in tech.

### My Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Go
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions
